# Scripts for cfMeDIP-seq data analysis
This repository contains the scripts related to Halla-aho and L채hdesm채ki (2021). The directory `scripts` contains the R-scripts where the methods are defined. The R and bash scripts where it is shown how the methods are used in each case have been divided into subdirectories

- `feature_selection`
- `model_training`
- `AUC_calculation`
- `figures

As the aim of Halla-aho and L채hdesm채ki (2021) was to compare results from different methods to the methods presented in Shen et al. (2018), we utilised the methods from [] to reproduce the results. The scripts from [] were utilised for data split generation, DMR finding, GLMNet model training and AUC calculation. For this purpose we used scripts from [], [] and [].
